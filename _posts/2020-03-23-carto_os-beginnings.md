I've finally bitten the bullet and made a website about myself.

Why you ask?

Well on the off chance someone reads this years after this post, we've are currently being advised to stay at home due to COVID19 aka Coronavirus. 

Since I'm stuck at home with my day consisting of doing my thesis and my other courses, I thought why not try making a personal website?

So to the reader who dares ventures and reads this, I wish you well and hope you enjoy your stay :)!
