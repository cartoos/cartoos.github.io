I've finally bitten the bullet and made a website about myself.

Why you ask?

Well on the off chance someone reads this years after this post, we've been told to practice the art of social isolation. 
Now the introvert of me loves this, my issue is my day consists of reading research article/paper ad nauseam, which one can only do so long. So I thought why not try making a website and practice my writing skills through public posts?

So that's the long short of it. So expect more posts from me on all things spatial, whether that be Digital Twins, Smart Cities, AI, Machine Learning, Hyperspectral Imagery and every other imaginable buzzword for 'innovations/new edge technology' spatial bandwagons on till student related topics like Networking, Volunteering, Event Naviagation and more. If it is has a spatial element to it, I might write about it. 

So to the reader who dares ventures and reads this, I wish you well and hope I don't aggravate you too much with my terrible writing ability!
