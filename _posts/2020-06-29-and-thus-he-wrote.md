Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
I have been told that I have interesting thoughts, perspectives and questions about what happens in this industry as a student. 
Problem? They have no way of sharing it outside of bringing me along to talk about it again. 
Solution? Writing about it?

I have no idea if this will work or not, but you do not know, if you do not try. 
A certain lecturer constanly reminds me of that.... 

Anyway, I am rambling, so hopefully I will write a bunch of posts or I will not. Who knows?
